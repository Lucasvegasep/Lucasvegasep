👋 HELLO!!!!, I am Lucas Alejandro Vega Sepúlveda

 👀 I'm interested in creating my first Git page, to demonstrate my current and future projects!!
 🌱 I am currently deepening my knowledge in programming with different languages, due to my training in Industrial Civil Engineering,
I have junior and basic knowledge of languages ​​such as (R, C++, Vb, Python, and DAX) but I am deepening my knowledge to be able to integrate this knowledge with my
skills in the area of ​​IT project management. ⚡⚡⚡
 
 💞️ I would like to collaborate in software development teams, particularly in global and multidisciplinary projects.
